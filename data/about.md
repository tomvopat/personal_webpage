Hi, I'm Tomas, a software developer based in Helsinki, Finland, with a degree in Computer Science and four years of experience in the telecommunications industry at Ericsson. I specialized in AI and machine learning during my studies at the Czech Technical University and the University of Helsinki.

Starting as a trainee at Ericsson, I quickly advanced to an experienced developer, focusing on cloud-native and virtual network functions that register mobile clients in operator networks. My technical proficiency spans multiple programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and Erlang. I also possess deep knowledge of Linux, IP networks, concurrent applications, CI, and ML/AI. Additionally, I am well-versed in Kubernetes and virtual machines, and I am currently pursuing Google Cloud certification.

I have a strong passion for solving algorithmic challenges and staying updated with cutting-edge technologies. Driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact that improves people's lives, I am committed to continuous self-improvement.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling and engaging in various sports such as skiing, surfing, and jogging. I also love playing computer games and board games, and I am an avid reader of books on self-improvement. Additionally, I am currently learning Finnish to better integrate into my local community.

I am currently open to new opportunities where I can bring my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team.
