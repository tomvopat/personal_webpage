Hi there! My name is Tomas, and I am a professional software developer specializing in IMS in the telecom industry. My passion lies in exploring new technologies and approaches that can help me develop efficient and innovative solutions to complex challenges. I have extensive experience in cloud computing, containers, AI, Linux, and DevOps, and I am always on the lookout for new tools and techniques to improve my work.

When I'm not working, I like to stay active and engaged in various hobbies and interests. I enjoy skiing during the winter and windsurfing in the summer months, which keeps me physically fit and also helps me to relax and clear my mind. I am an avid reader of non-fictional books and often find inspiration from different perspectives and ideas.

Apart from my hobbies, I am committed to continuing my education and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in my industry. I dedicate time to self-study, online courses, and attending workshops to further my understanding of new software systems and techniques. This helps me to remain agile and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of software development.

Through this website, I hope to share my insights and experiences in the world of software development with others in the industry. I strongly believe that sharing knowledge and ideas is essential for growth and development, and I am excited to contribute my own unique perspective to the conversation. Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you find my content useful!
